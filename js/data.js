[00:03.95]演唱：艾志恒Asen
[00:12.63] No need to cry
[00:13.93] 窗外也在下雨
[00:15.73] 打开简讯又是
[00:17.35] "你在哪里？"
[00:19.47] 我在哪儿其实不重要
[00:22.42] Like I told you we won't work out
[00:25.35] No need to cry you just want my body
[00:29.19] My body
[00:31.12] Then I tell you all these lies
[00:32.58] 你知道后也不会多意外
[00:34.57] 根本不需要去猜
[00:36.19] Cuz I really don't like you
[00:39.45] I really don't like you
[00:42.80] 我讨厌你在我面前装酷
[00:44.89] 我讨厌每次接你电话都听你诉苦
[00:48.02] 但现在我终于解脱
[00:50.53] But I don't know
[00:52.20] Don't know where to go
[00:54.08] 等你松手
[00:55.39] 不知道往哪儿走
[00:57.77] I should go back to my home
[00:59.80] But I don't have one
[01:01.06] 只有你能满足我的要求
[01:04.53] 这是最后一次跟你联络
[01:07.80] 你我清楚不需要再点破
[01:11.11] 这场戏我俩也算是演过
[01:16.36] No need to cry

[01:34.18] Maybe I need you
[01:38.75] No I can't lose you
[01:43.35] Cuz maybe I want you
[01:47.71] Just you
[01:50.06] You are the only one
